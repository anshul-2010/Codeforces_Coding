Niveath attended the session on Loops and got really excited to try out some problems.

Given two integers a and b, print the numbers in range [a,b] respecting the following conditions:

Step1 : Initially, x=a.
Step2 : Skip the next x integers and print the next number. Change x to the value printed right now.
Repeat step2 as long as x≤b.
Note: Each line must not contain more than 4 numbers, so format the printing of each number accordingly.
Numbers in the same column must have their first digits aligned, this is explained in the notes section.
Refer to the examples for more clarity.

Input
2 integers a and b (0<a≤b<106).

Output
All the numbers from a upto b respecting the above conditions, and with appropriate formatting.

    int aaa=0;

    {
        cout << i;
        cout << "\t";

        if(aaa%4==0)
