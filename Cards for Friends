'''
For the New Year, Polycarp decided to send postcards to all his n friends. He wants to make postcards with his own hands. For this purpose, he has a sheet of paper of size w×h, which can be cut into pieces.

Polycarp can cut any sheet of paper w×h that he has in only two cases:

If w is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size w2×h;
If h is even, then he can cut the sheet in half and get two sheets of size w×h2;
If w and h are even at the same time, then Polycarp can cut the sheet according to any of the rules above.

After cutting a sheet of paper, the total number of sheets of paper is increased by 1.

Help Polycarp to find out if he can cut his sheet of size w×h at into n or more pieces, using only the rules described above.

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers w, h, n (1≤w,h≤104,1≤n≤109) — the width and height of the sheet Polycarp has and the number of friends he needs to send a postcard to.

Output
For each test case, output on a separate line:

"YES", if it is possible to cut a sheet of size w×h into at least n pieces;
"NO" otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).
