Nachiketh attended the session on Loops and got really excited to try out some problems.

Let n be any positive integer. If n is even, then set n=n2, else set n=3n+1.

Repeat this process indefinitely.

What will be the last number you end up with? For instance starting with 12, we get the sequence of 12,6,3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1. This sequence is called the Collatz Sequence for 12.

Does it converge to 1 for every number n? We believe so! This is called the Collatz Conjecture.

Write a program to accept a positive integer n and print its Collatz Sequence, separated by a single space.

Input
A single integer n (1≤n≤104). n will be given such that it's Collatz Sequence does not exceed 104 numbers.

Output
Print the Collatz Sequence of n, separating the terms of the sequence by a single space.
'''
n=int(input())
print(n,end=' ')
while(n!=1):
    if(n%2==0):
        n=int(n/2)
        print(n,end=' ')
    else:
        n=3*n+1 
        print(n,end=' ')
