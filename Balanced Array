You are given a positive integer n, it is guaranteed that n is even (i.e. divisible by 2).

You want to construct the array a of length n such that:

The first n2 elements of a are even (divisible by 2);
the second n2 elements of a are odd (not divisible by 2);
all elements of a are distinct and positive;
the sum of the first half equals to the sum of the second half (∑i=1n2ai=∑i=n2+1nai).
If there are multiple answers, you can print any. It is not guaranteed that the answer exists.

You have to answer t independent test cases.

Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains one integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array. It is guaranteed that that n is even (i.e. divisible by 2).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105 (∑n≤2⋅105).

Output
For each test case, print the answer — "NO" (without quotes), if there is no suitable answer for the given test case or "YES" in the first line and any suitable array a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) satisfying conditions from the problem statement on the second line.
